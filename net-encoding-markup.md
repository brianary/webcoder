Encoding Markup in .NET
=======================

There are at least four ways to escape HTML or XML characters to entities in .NET, but they work quite differently.

> TL;DR: In #PowerShell, the best options to encode to HTML or XML are
> `[Security.SecurityElement]::Escape()` (minimal)
> or `[Text.Encodings.Web.HtmlEncoder]::Default.Encode()` (comprehensive).

[Escape][]
----------

`System.Security.SecurityElement.Escape()` is the simplest encoder, only escaping `&` `<` `>` `"` and `'` and
passing through all other characters unchanged.

This is fine if you want something lightweight, and you don't need to force the output to 7-bit ASCII for compatibility,
either because the input is already 7-bit, or because the output can acceptably use more complex encodings.

### Escape Effect

- U+0022 QUOTATION MARK is always encoded as the named entity `&quot;`.
- U+0026 AMPERSAND is always encoded as the named entity `&amp;`.
- U+0027 APOSTROPHE is encoded as the named entity `&apos;`,.
- U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN is always encoded as the named entity `&lt;`.
- U+003D EQUALS SIGN is passed through unchanged.
- U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN is always encoded as the named entity `&gt;`.

[Encode][]
----------

`System.Text.Encodings.Web.HtmlEncoder.Default.Encode()` is a more comprehensive encoder to not only encode the bare
minimum characters, but also to encode anything outside 7-bit ASCII for compatibility, using hex codepoint entities
instead of named entities, which work for both HTML and XML.

### Encode Effect

- U+0022 QUOTATION MARK is always encoded as the named entity `&quot;`.
- U+0026 AMPERSAND is always encoded as the named entity `&amp;`.
- U+0027 APOSTROPHE is encoded as the hex entity `&#x27;`,.
- U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN is always encoded as the named entity `&lt;`.
- U+003D EQUALS SIGN is passed through unchanged.
- U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN is always encoded as the named entity `&gt;`.

[HtmlEncode][]
--------------

`System.Web.HttpUtility.HtmlEncode()` encodes 8-bit ASCII or Latin-1 characters to 7-bit ASCII using decimal codepoint
entities, which isn't as comprehensive, and anything above codepoint U+00FF don't seem to be preserved accurately,
so this seems like a less reliable encoder.

### HtmlEncode Effect

- U+0022 QUOTATION MARK is always encoded as the named entity `&quot;`.
- U+0026 AMPERSAND is always encoded as the named entity `&amp;`.
- U+0027 APOSTROPHE is encoded as the decimal entity `&#39;`,.
- U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN is always encoded as the named entity `&lt;`.
- U+003D EQUALS SIGN is passed through unchanged.
- U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN is always encoded as the named entity `&gt;`.

üèöÔ∏è [AntiXssEncoder][]
---------------------

`System.Web.Security.AntiXss.AntiXssEncoder` offered a variety of encoding choices, but was discontinued after .NET Framework 4.8.1.

Encoding is accomplished with any of three methods: [`HtmlEncode()`], [`XmlAttributeEncode()`], or [`XmlEncode()`].

These only encode codepoints up through U+00A0 then U+0370 and above as a decimal entity, and mangles a bunch of the characters in the
ranges it doesn't encode, so it's a bad choice for a number of reasons.

### AntiXssEncoder Effect

| codepoint(s)  | name        | encoded? |     format     |
| ------------- | ----------- | :------: | :------------: |
| U+0000‚ÄìU+001F | C0 Controls |    ‚úîÔ∏è     | `&#0;`‚Äì`&#31;` |

- U+0020 SPACE is only encoded as `&#32;` by `XmlAttributeEncode()`, the other methods pass it through.
- U+0021 EXCLAMATION MARK is passed through unchanged.
- U+0022 QUOTATION MARK is always encoded as the named entity `&quot;`.
- U+0023‚ÄìU+0025 are passed through unchanged.
- U+0026 AMPERSAND is always encoded as the named entity `&amp;`.
- U+0027 APOSTROPHE is encoded as the named entity `&apos;` by the XML methods, and as `&#39;` for the HTML method (for compatibility).
- U+0028‚ÄìU+003B are passed through unchanged.
- U+003C LESS-THAN SIGN is always encoded as the named entity `&lt;`.
- U+003D EQUALS SIGN is passed through unchanged.
- U+003E GREATER-THAN SIGN is always encoded as the named entity `&gt;`.
- U+003F‚ÄìU+007E are passed through unchanged.
- U+007F‚ÄìU+00A0 are encoded as decimal entities.
- U+00A1‚ÄìU+036F are clobbered, except U+00AD SOFT HYPHEN which is encoded as a decimal entity.
- U+0370‚ÄìU+FFFF are encoded as decimal entities.
