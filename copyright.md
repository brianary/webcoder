Reasonable Copyright Requests
=============================

* Please, NO damage awards based on [decades-old, half-remembered, vastly inflated, and entirely unscientific extrapolation of a rough estimate of copyright losses due to fake tractor parts](https://boingboing.net/2009/09/14/patrys-moral-panics.html "Patry's MORAL PANICS AND THE COPYRIGHT WARS: elegant, calm, reasonable history of the copyfight / Boing Boing").
* Please, NO enforcement that accepts accusation as conviction. In this country we are presumed innocent.
* Please, NO enforcement that restricts or constrains Internet access. The Internet is where we work, and play, and socialize, and seek medical advice and employment, and have political discussions, and provide feedback to elected officials.
* Please, do not sacrifice free speech for corporate profits and Hollywood campaign donations.
* Please, NO mandates for ISPs to snoop on their customers. That is an end-run around the Fourth Amendment, and will inevitably prove to be a corrupting power.
* Please, protect fair use and punish blanket takedown notices and automated copyright dragnets and other baseless legal bullying.
* Please, ensure that groups purporting to collect royalties for artists are actually paying the artists, and at the agreed-upon rate for what is being sold or licensed.
* Please, ensure that companies externalizing the cost of enforcement of their copyrights to the government are actually paying their taxes.
* Please, stop referring to unauthorized copying as theft (theft deprives the original owner of something), or piracy (piracy is a very real life-threatening issue that should not be trivialized).
* Please, accept that DRM is never going to work technically, and only serves to frustrate legal purchasers of content.
* Please, refuse to give "digital locks", EULAs, and terms of service special legal protection that allows content distributors to define de facto laws their users must comply or [face criminal charges](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20101022/01570011536/judge-refuses-to-dismiss-criminal-charges-for-violating-ticketmaster-s-terms-of-service-trial-moves-forward.shtml).
* Please, stop bundling music and movies with pharmaceuticals. Using fear about counterfeit drugs is a cheap tactic.
* Please, stop demonizing Canada in particular for specious copyright transgressions.
* Please, NO more pressuring other countries to accept our laws on their soil.
* Please, NO calls for "consistency" as a tactic to continue to gradually tighten copyright worldwide by finding corruptable or sympathetic regimes to pass draconian copyright laws and then calling for "parity".
* Please, consult with Cory Doctorow [http://craphound.com/](http://craphound.com/) , the EFF [http://www.eff.org/](http://www.eff.org/) , and the CDT [http://www.cdt.org/](http://www.cdt.org/) .

Personally, I'd like to see us return to a pre-DMCA world where copyright was a civil matter. Sadly, I've scaled back my hopes significantly, and I now just don't want anyone to destroy freedom to protect a specific business model.

A New Caste System
------------------

Welcome to the new caste system. You are either a Creator (noble) or a Consumer (pleb/serf).

Plebs don't get to own anything, like the music, movies, books, or [software](http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/09/magic-words-trump-user-rights-ninth-circuit-ruling) they buy; they may only _license_ what they purchase. [No one without an existing defensive copyright/patent portfolio will be able to become a Creator](http://consumerist.com/2010/09/the-george-lucas-death-star-tries-to-obliterate-my-startup.html), [since "creation" is only achieved by transforming or combining existing ideas](http://binarybonsai.com/2010/09/18/george-lucas-stole-chewbacca-but-its-okay/).

Slowly, the scope will creep as you are required to pay a periodic license fee for the [architecture](http://www.critiquethis.us/2009/07/31/%C2%A9-architecture-copyright-infringement/) you live in, the design of the [furniture](http://www.iptrademarkattorney.com/2008/06/los-angeles-copyright-attorney-furniture-copyright-infringement-bed-chest-corzine.html) you use, the [clothing](http://www.copyright.gov/docs/regstat072706.html) and [shoes](http://yro.slashdot.org/story/10/09/09/2248221/Swedish-Police-Shoe-Database-May-Tread-On-Copyright?from=rss&utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+Slashdot/slashdotYourRightsOnline+(Slashdot:+Your+Rights+Online)) you wear, &c.

Punishment for unauthorized copying/use ("piracy") will just get more draconian, initially as [entire households are excommunicated from the Internet for unsubstantiated accusation](http://www.boingboing.net/2010/09/15/uk-government-hands.html?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed:+boingboing/iBag+(Boing+Boing)&utm_content=Google+Reader) by the corporate scanbots, but ultimately as ["intellectual" "property" (imaginary property) enforcement provides an excuse for capricious, arbitrary, and unlimited affronts to legal rights of protestors and dissidents](http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2010/09/jack-booted-thugs-and-copyright-enforcement).

So, anyway, happy Wednesday.
